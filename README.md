Huckel theory applied to molecular motors

Huckel theory is a semi-emperical technique to perform pen-and-paper quantum chemical calculations on unsaturated hydrocarbons. For more complicated structures, simple programming exercises (in Python) can suffice. A key problem in performing these computations is matrix diagonalization

$(h - \epsilon_i)Sc_i = 0$

A small computer exercise that uses an online Huckel code to predict the red-shifting upon substitution of a molecular motors
