Huckel theory applied to molecular motors

Introduction
============
Huckel theory is a semi-emperical technique to perform pen-and-paper quantum chemical calculations on unsaturated hydrocarbons. For more complicated structures, simple programming exercises (in Python) can suffice. A key problem in performing these computations is matrix diagonalization.

A small computer exercise that uses an online Huckel code to predict the red-shifting upon substitution of a molecular motors

Installation
============
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heinen1/huckel_exercise
```

Usage
=====
**Solve Huckel equations using Python**
```bash
python butadiene.py
```

**Molecular motors exercises:**

Load the 'motor1.com' and 'motor2.com' files into HuLiS and calculate the corresponding HOMO and LUMO orbitals.
